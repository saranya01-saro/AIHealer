"When you look at death, it makes you understand the importance of the moment when you have life and death in front of you, and you witness seeing someone deteriorating in front of you - it's an overwhelming experience. If you don't learn from that, I don't know what else you're gonna learn."

I don't take it very seriously. You shouldn't let your success get to your head or failure get to your heart. This is most commonly said. But people don't really practise it. I don't see myself as a celebrity; it has not sunk in. I just see myself as someone doing a nine-to-six job like a techie.
Love is the only reality and it is not a mere sentiment. It is the ultimate truth that lies at the heart of creation.

"Mr. Christ, I read you as an infinitely patient entity who, as they say, often works in mysterious ways, a rebel unafraid to take the tougher, less traveled paths.

"Gay rights is just a matter of time. Look at the polls. Worrying about gay marriage, let alone gay civil unions or gay employment rights, is a middle-age issue. Young people just can't see the problem. At worst, gays are going to win this one just by waiting until the opposition dies off."
Wisdom is knowing what to do next; virtue is doing it.
I am dumb when it comes to learning dance steps.
"I failed at the biggest things there are in life. I failed in my health, I failed in my marriage, I failed in everything, and I've picked myself up and gone on."
"Indulging in unrestrained and immoderate laughter is a sign of intemperance, of a want of control over one's emotions, and of failure to repress the soul's frivolity by a stern use of reason."
Wisdom allows nothing to be good that will not be so forever; no man to be happy but he that needs no other happiness than what he has within himself; no man to be great or powerful that is not master of himself.
"If you set your goals ridiculously high and it's a failure, you will fail above everyone else's success."
"At Microsoft, we're aspiring to have a living, learning culture with a growth mindset that allows us to learn from ourselves and our customers. These are the key attributes of the new culture at Microsoft, and I feel great about how it seems to be resonating and how it's seen as empowering."
"We love but once, for once only are we perfectly equipped for loving."
Never complain and never explain.
The only real failure in life is one not learned from.
Wisdom is the supreme part of happiness.
"To know how to grow old is the master work of wisdom, and one of the most difficult chapters in the great art of living."
You change your life by changing your heart.
"We have got this tailspin of culture, in our inner cities in particular, of men not working and just generations of men not even thinking about working or learning the value and the culture of work, and so there is a real culture problem here that has to be dealt with."
Love is the only gold.
"Now, if you notice how the swan, putting its neck down into the deep water, brings up food for itself from below, then you will discover the wisdom of the Creator, in that He gave it a neck longer than its feet for this reason, that it might, as if lowering a sort of fishing line, procure the food hidden in the deep water."
What I love most about this crazy life is the adventure of it.
"By developing deep learning solutions that are faster, easier, and less expensive to use, Nervana is democratizing deep learning and fueling advances in medical diagnostics, image and speech recognition, genomics, agriculture, finance, and eventually across all industries."
"It is difficult to get organic food at most restaurants, so when possible, eat at home. When not, do your best."
Focus on being balanced - success is balance.
"First, I have to thank God for giving me the gift that he did as well as a second chance for a better life."
Friendship and money: oil and water.
"It's not beauty but fine qualities, my girl, that keep a husband."
We pass through this world but once.
Life ought to be a struggle of desire toward adventures whose nobility will fertilize the soul.
I can give you a six-word formula for success: Think things through - then follow through.
"I have no control over what people think of me but I have 100% control of what I think of myself, and that is so important. And not just about your body, but so many ways of confidence. You're constantly learning how to be confident, aren't you?"
"If there's a rift in the marriage - if someone feels neglected, frustrated, tempted by others, or unsure - then trouble can easily arise."
"It's a horrible idea that God, this paragon of wisdom and knowledge, power, couldn't think of a better way to forgive us our sins than to come down to Earth in his alter ego as his son and have himself hideously tortured and executed so that he could forgive himself."
"You were made perfectly to be loved - and surely I have loved you, in the idea of you, my whole life long."
"I was 32 when I started cooking; up until then, I just ate."
"I'm actually pretty shy in real life. But I guess in front of the camera, I focus."
"Sometimes we should express our gratitude for the small and simple things like the scent of the rain, the taste of your favorite food, or the sound of a loved one's voice."
You've got to reach a hand of friendship across the aisle and across philosophies in this country.
Love is something far more than desire for sexual intercourse; it is the principal means of escape from the loneliness which afflicts most men and women throughout the greater part of their lives.
I think that every state in the union should recognize same-sex marriage.
Science is always discovering odd scraps of magical wisdom and making a tremendous fuss about its cleverness.
"Youth is not a time of life; it is a state of mind; it is not a matter of rosy cheeks, red lips and supple knees; it is a matter of the will, quality of the imagination, a vigor of the emotions; it is the freshness of the deep springs of life."
"Many people feel so pressured by the expectations of others that it causes them to be frustrated, miserable and confused about what they should do. But there is a way to live a simple, joy-filled, peaceful life, and the key is learning how to be led by the Holy Spirit, not the traditions or expectations of man."
We fall forward to succeed.
"I love the name of honor, more than I fear death."
The compensation of a very early success is a conviction that life is a romantic matter. In the best sense one stays young.
"There were times in 'Adaptation' during the editing where I really thought, 'Okay, well, this was a noble failure. I tried to do something good, but this is not going to work.'"
"I was writing an earnest novel about cruises in the Caribbean and I just started writing 'Bridget Jones' to get some money, to finance this earnest work, and then I chucked it out."
"Quality afterschool programs provide safe, engaging and fun learning experiences to help children and youth develop their social, emotional, physical, cultural and academic skills."
"The conventional wisdom is that if you are gay, you cannot play the romantic straight lead in a movie."
"Bad things do happen; how I respond to them defines my character and the quality of my life. I can choose to sit in perpetual sadness, immobilized by the gravity of my loss, or I can choose to rise from the pain and treasure the most precious gift I have - life itself."
War remains the decisive human failure.
"Love is a springtime plant that perfumes everything with its hope, even the ruins to which it clings."
"I never said I wanted a 'happy' life but an interesting one. From separation and loss, I have learned a lot. I have become strong and resilient, as is the case of almost every human being exposed to life and to the world. We don't even know how strong we are until we are forced to bring that hidden strength forward."
It has been said that 80% of what people learn is visual.
"As you navigate through the rest of your life, be open to collaboration. Other people and other people's ideas are often better than your own. Find a group of people who challenge and inspire you, spend a lot of time with them, and it will change your life."
Let us now set forth one of the fundamental truths about marriage: the wife is in charge.
"There's food and supplements that you can take legally that will better your body and help you stay healthy. Shortcuts are something that's always been around all sports, but as a union, we're trying to do the best we can to weed those guys out of the game."
"I eat mostly organic, but I love macaroni and cheese, Mexican food, and egg-and-cheese croissants. So when I indulge, I eat protein and veggies for the rest of the day. It really is all about moderation and balance."
"I love food, all food, everything about food. I enjoy going to the market and having what's in front of me - what's fresh, seasonal - tell me what I'm cooking."
"In the richest country in the history of the world, this Obama economy has crushed the middle class. Family income has fallen by $4,000, but health insurance premiums are higher, food prices are higher, utility bills are higher, and gasoline prices have doubled. Today more Americans wake up in poverty than ever before."
"I like a well-roasted rotisserie chicken and eggs cooked various ways, like sunny-side up or scrambled. It's comfort food for me."
"Most Americans are fiscally conservative and socially liberal. I'm advocating a balanced budget. But along with that, look, there should be gay marriage equality. A woman should have the right to choose. Let's not build a fence across the border."
"Orange juice from concentrate is labeled. Food coloring Red #5 is labeled. Fish are labeled as to whether they've been previously frozen. To a consumer, there's no plausible reason why these factors should be on a food ingredient label while the presence of GMOs shouldn't be."
"To know oneself, one should assert oneself."
"I think there was a time in my life, probably in college, that I wished every guy was gay because it meant more women for me! I don't know what everyone's problem with it is. I wish everyone was gay! That's always the way I thought about it. I have no issue with it. If I have to suffer through marriage, why shouldn't they?"
"If your goal is to lose 10 pounds, you may wake up each day with failure in mind because the goal is hard to reach, and you are progressing only by small amounts. It takes up all your willpower. I recommend that instead of a goal, you have a system."
Give me the luxuries of life and I will willingly do without the necessities.
What happens is not as important as how you react to what happens.
Success isn't a result of spontaneous combustion. You must set yourself on fire.
"Many a man in his hour of trial has turned to the Book of Mormon and been enlightened, enlivened, and comforted. The psalms in the Old Testament have a special food for the soul of one in distress."
Find ecstasy in life; the mere sense of living is joy enough.
"Honesty is the rarest wealth anyone can possess, and yet all the honesty in the world ain't lawful tender for a loaf of bread."
"That some achieve great success, is proof to all that others can achieve it as well."
"A friend is a beloved mystery; dearest always because he is not ourself, and has something in him which it is impossible for us to fathom. If it were not so, friendship would lose its chief zest."
"Community organizing is all about building grassroots support. It's about identifying the people around you with whom you can create a common, passionate cause. And it's about ignoring the conventional wisdom of company politics and instead playing the game by very different rules."
Friendship always benefits; love sometimes injures.
Wisdom is knowledge which has become a part of one's being.
Success comes from taking the initiative and following up... persisting... eloquently expressing the depth of your love. What simple action could you take today to produce a new momentum toward success in your life?
"I believe the friendship of the Games still exists. There is a tremendous camaraderie and atmosphere at the Olympic and Commonwealth Games - where else could you go and sit down and have breakfast with a Russian weightlifter, an East German sprinter, and an Indian fencer and talk about different cultures and problems?"
"My grandmother lived to 104 years old, and part of her success was she woke up every morning to a brand new day. She said every morning is a new gift. Her favorite hobby was collecting birthdays."
That old law about 'an eye for an eye' leaves everybody blind. The time is always right to do the right thing.
The Bible is clear - God's definition of marriage is between a man and a woman.
"In politics, what begins in fear usually ends in failure."
Life consists not in holding good cards but in playing those you hold well.
Life is a zoo in a jungle.
"Sailing is the closest I can get to nature - it's adrenaline, fear, a constant challenge and learning experience, an adventure into the unknown. And of course there is nothing better than wearing the same T-shirt for days and not brushing my hair for weeks."
Most great people have attained their greatest success just one step beyond their greatest failure.
"How far you go in life depends on your being tender with the young, compassionate with the aged, sympathetic with the striving and tolerant of the weak and strong. Because someday in your life you will have been all of these."
I fall in love every day. Not with people but with situations.
The unexamined life is not worth living.
"I feel like that I'm learning all the time. I'm learning from new artists, from established artists... every time I listen to '70s rock 'n' roll records, I'm learning. And I think that I'm just now starting to get a hold on what I do."
Gay marriage acceptance is happening in the blink of an eye.
"All I can think is that the owners of Chick-Fil-A have decided they have had enough, that they're just going to focus on selling chicken sandwiches to as many people as they can, and they figure that keeping their views about marriage to themselves is better than having a bunch of angry activists on your doorstep."
I think it's never too late to learn - or it's a lesson that's good to continue learning - that you need to treat everyone on a set with respect.
The secret to a long marriage is to stay gone.
Our life is what our thoughts make it.
"I have two different categories of favorite films. One is the emotional favorites, which means these are generally films that I saw when I was a kid; anything you see in your formative years is more powerful, because it really stays with you forever. The second category is films that I saw while I was learning the craft of motion pictures."
"A song like 'Once in a Lifetime' is inspired by my marriage - it's a good, life-changing happening in my life. I think when you find your once-in-a-lifetime love, that's what everybody's looking for."
"Success is the progressive realization of predetermined, worthwhile, personal goals."
"Originally, I was against gay marriage because I was opposed to all marriage, being an old-fashioned gay bohemian. The straight people I knew in the sixties were very much opposed to it. I was, too, and it was never a possibility for gays, but when I saw how opposed the Religious Right was to it, I thought it a fight worth fighting."
We come to love not by finding a perfect person but by learning to see an imperfect person perfectly.
Share your smile with the world. It's a symbol of friendship and peace.
Elegance is not a dispensable luxury but a factor that decides between success and failure.
"The whole business of reading English Literature in two years, to know it in any reputable sense of the word - let alone your learning to write English - is, in short, impossible."
"To love for the sake of being loved is human, but to love for the sake of loving is angelic."
"You have an impeccable argument if you said that Singapore, Hong Kong, and Tokyo are food capitals. They have a maximum amount of great stuff to eat in the smallest areas."
I'm pro-forwards. Do I want the Seventies to come back? No. The haircuts were terrible. Everyone stank. The food was awful.
My mom and I always had a great bond. It was always a natural friendship bond since early on. My mom was 18 when she had me.
"The thing is that love gives us a ringside seat on somebody else's flaws, so of course you're gonna spot some things that kinda need to be mentioned. But often the romantic view is to say, 'If you loved me, you wouldn't criticise me.' Actually, true love is often about trying to teach someone how to be the best version of themselves."
I think what makes our marriage work amid all the glare is that my husband is my best friend. He inspires everything in my life and enables me to do the best that I can. I want to hang out with him more than anyone.
My thoughts are that marriage is between a man and a woman.
"She got the magazine on a Wednesday morning, and on Thursday announced our marriage was over."
"God has already done everything He's going to do. The ball is now in your court. If you want success, if you want wisdom, if you want to be prosperous and healthy, you're going to have to do more than meditate and believe; you must boldly declare words of faith and victory over yourself and your family."
"My life is part humor, part roses, part thorns."
What we have most to fear is failure of the heart.
Anybody who dies with money in the bank is a failure.
Friendship is one mind in two bodies.
"I'm not ashamed to be me. More than anyone else I know, I love my life and accept myself. What's wrong with being unique? I am proud of everything that I am and will become."
"Where we love is home - home that our feet may leave, but not our hearts."
Being in love is the best feeling on the planet. I really believe that love makes the world go round.
"If you cannot work on the marriage or the women is a moron, staying married and cheating makes the most sense because divorce is disruptive to the family life and your bank account."
Words do two major things: They provide food for the mind and create light for understanding and awareness.
Love will draw an elephant through a key-hole.
"My mom did not have money. She was a single mom, on and off in periods between marriages. My husband, however, grew up on a wonderful farm in Tuscany, in Florence, and his family was so entertaining in terms of growing their own food and using the fruit of their land. We have very, very different experiences."
"It is love, not reason, that is stronger than death."
Finance is a gun. Politics is knowing when to pull the trigger.
You create your opportunities by asking for them.
"For a guy who used to steal watches on the streets of Chandni Chowk for kicks, I surely think my success at the age of 22 was pretty early!"
"Some people ask the secret of our long marriage. We take time to go to a restaurant two times a week. A little candlelight, dinner, soft music and dancing. She goes Tuesdays, I go Fridays."
"We all thought of chicken as lean, protein-rich food that's good for weight watching, but the truth is chicken might actually be making us fatter!"
I believe that every single event in life happens in an opportunity to choose love over fear.
Try to learn something about everything and everything about something.
I enjoyed the whole process of learning and was always happy when autumn came and school or college started up again.
I'm more afraid of marriage than death.
No man is regular in his attendance at the House of Commons until he is married.
Don't marry the person you think you can live with; marry only the individual you think you can't live without.
"When our weaknesses affect health and friendship, we are very much aware of their existence."
It's both rebellion and conformity that attack you with success.
"I live a healthy lifestyle and I crave healthy food. I love porridge - I have bizarre cravings for it. I love it with brown sugar and bananas, and I'm a huge fan of cinnamon - I put cinnamon on everything. I also have a sweet tooth and I don't like to deprive myself. I think everything in moderation is the key."
"The solution as consumers is - perhaps surprisingly - to take adverts very, very seriously. We should ask ourselves what it is that we find lovely in them - the visions of friendship, togetherness, repose, or whatever. And then consider what would actually help us find these qualities in our lives."
"On the one hand, the idea of marriage and the sort of traditional family life repulses me. But on the other hand, I long for it, you know what I mean? I'm constantly in conflict with things. And it is because of my past and my upbringing and the journey that I've been on."
"A poet could write volumes about diners, because they're so beautiful. They're brightly lit, with chrome and booths and Naugahyde and great waitresses. Now, it might not be so great in the health department, but I think diner food is really worth experiencing periodically."
"There is a mutual interest between Israel and the United States of America. It is more than friendship - it is friendship plus mutual interest, and it is bipartisan."
We need to accept that the commandments of God aren't just a long list of good ideas. They aren't 'life hacks' from an Internet blog or motivational quotes from a Pinterest board.
"Doing things like playing music, something that's so natural and basic to human function, running around in nature, eating delicious food. These things are intrinsic in basic, primordial to human beings, so that's sort of a way to return to a blank canvas, allowing my true personality to return."
"It's failure, really, that you grow by, although nobody likes to experience it."
"For me, the good food starts with good product."
Money is not a motivating factor. Money doesn't thrill me or make me play better because there are benefits to being wealthy. I'm just happy with a ball at my feet. My motivation comes from playing the game I love. If I wasn't paid to be a professional footballer I would willingly play for nothing.
Why should we think upon things that are lovely? Because thinking determines life. It is a common habit to blame life upon the environment. Environment modifies life but does not govern life. The soul is stronger than its surroundings.
"The more painful it is, tragically, the more you do learn, though, that's the good part."
"In those early years in New York when I was a stranger in a big city, it was the companionship and later friendship which I was offered in the Linnean Society that was the most important thing in my life."
"I've always wanted to be a mom because I want to give a kid all of the magical gifts my mom gave to me, such as love and friendship. She and I had this incredible connection that was so unbelievable."
"Blunders, no, only friendship binds us to honesty - attracting crypts of mushrooms in the wake of our snowboards."
"Men are taught that if we are not the ultimate provider, we are a complete failure. We have to be number one in everything we do. There is nothing more delusional or paralysing than what I have just described."
One of the greatest pieces of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know.
"We are all born with a unique genetic blueprint, which lays out the basic characteristics of our personality as well as our physical health and appearance... And yet, we all know that life experiences do change us."
I arise in the morning torn between a desire to improve the world and a desire to enjoy the world. This makes it hard to plan the day.
"Peace and friendship with all mankind is our wisest policy, and I wish we may be permitted to pursue it."
"Red is such an interesting color to correlate with emotion, because it's on both ends of the spectrum. On one end you have happiness, falling in love, infatuation with someone, passion, all that. On the other end, you've got obsession, jealousy, danger, fear, anger and frustration."
"Loyalty and friendship, which is to me the same, created all the wealth that I've ever thought I'd have."
"I'm fascinated by failure, and I'm fascinated by finality. Shakespeare's historical plays are more universal than his comedies because they relate to the finality of life. Without finality, life would not be beautiful."
"I love being. There's so much wisdom in it. You wake up in the morning and you think, Hey, isn't it great just being?"
"I don't think there's anything they can say about me that I haven't said about myself already. And I would be an absolute total liar, and my fans would not respect me, if I said that my life and my marriage are perfect. But we absolutely love each other; we have fun together - it's great."
"If you have no confidence in self, you are twice defeated in the race of life."
"A huge part of swimming for me is I love it, and it is so much fun."

"But all actors go through the process, it's hit and miss, you have achievement and failure."
Never have a companion that casts you in the shade.
"I am aloof by nature. I mind my own business. I'm good with everyone, and I get along fine with people. But work is work, and friendship is friendship. I never mix the two."
"I think if you look at the failure of journalism in the modern age, then I don't want to be called a journalist."
"Success or failure depends more upon attitude than upon capacity successful men act as though they have accomplished or are enjoying something. Soon it becomes a reality. Act, look, feel successful, conduct yourself accordingly, and you will be amazed at the positive results."
Better be wise by the misfortunes of others than by your own.
"It's easy to be lazy when there's food lying around backstage or there's a fast-food joint a couple blocks away. But if you walk a little further, ask around a bit, of course there are exciting things to discover."
To good and true love fear is forever affixed.
"I would love to have the same rights as everybody else. I would love, I don't care if it's called marriage. I don't care if it's called, you know, domestic partnership. I don't care what it's called."
Your heaviest artillery will be your will to live. Keep that big gun going.
"Giving back, doing motivational speeches and stuff like that, that's always made me feel good. If you repeatedly go out there, and you are the change that you want to see, then that's what you are."

"As I grow older, I think friendship between women is a thing to cherish."

"Like any friendship or marriage, familiarity breeds more contempt, and love, and everything."
"Students teach all sorts of things but most importantly they make explicit the courage that it takes to be a learner, the courage it takes to open yourself to the transformative power of real learning and that courage I am exposed to almost every day at MIT and that I'm deeply grateful for."
"If we do not change our negative habits toward climate change, we can count on worldwide disruptions in food production, resulting in mass migration, refugee crises and increased conflict over scarce natural resources like water and farm land. This is a recipe for major security problems."
Youth is something I never wanna take for granted. I just want to smile and live life.
"We cannot insist only on issues related to abortion, gay marriage and the use of contraceptive methods. The teaching of the church is clear, and I am a son of the church, but it is not necessary to talk about these issues all the time."
Education is what remains after one has forgotten what one has learned in school.
"'I resolve to eat less food' sounds good in theory, but it's often hard to sustain. And if you believe that it's all willpower, then you're likely to be upset with yourself if you don't succeed."
The best proof of love is trust.
Success usually comes to those who are too busy to be looking for it.
"Ask any successful person to look back over the events of his or her life, and chances are there'll be a turning point of one kind or another. It doesn't matter if that success has come on a ball field or in a boardroom, in a research laboratory or on a campaign trail - it can usually be traced to some pivotal moment."
Smile in the mirror. Do that every morning and you'll start to see a big difference in your life.
"To see talented people in roles that others might not see them in, to see how they might fit in the puzzle of the cast, has always been something that I've been good at. I think that if you look at the successes of my films and start to peel them back, there's usually a really smart casting decision that has gone into that success."
"It is a changing world because of the newcomers who keep arriving and who leave us behind. Trying to keep pace with them is doomed to inglorious failure, especially as the pace has quickened so much."
"At my core, what I think we need to do is to get the basics right again. We need to rebuild our family structure, stay away from redefining marriage, and stand by marriage as a union between a man and a woman."
Money is the best rule of commerce.
Eighty percent of success is showing up.
"My own life is wonderful, but if I had to live the life of someone else, I'd gladly choose that of Julia Child or Dr. Seuss: two outrageously original people, each of whom fashioned an idiosyncratic wisdom, passion for life, and sense of humor into an art form that anyone and everyone could savor."
"To finance this trade deficit, the U.S. has to borrow from the rest of the world or sell American assets like stocks, businesses, and real estate to the rest of the world."
"My mother is not a model. She is not perfect. That awareness is part of learning to love someone. Predicting the actions of someone is an act of love. We persist, even when we get it wrong. That's the beauty of love."
"Basically, when you get to my age, you'll really measure your success in life by how many of the people you want to have love you actually do love you."
Love invites the Holy Ghost to be present to confirm truth. And the joy of learning divine truths creates love in the hearts of people who shared the experience of learning.
"Always be a first-rate version of yourself, instead of a second-rate version of somebody else."
"If the whole process of learning from failure means discarding stuff that's not working, but in fact, our natural reaction is to keep going, to throw more money behind it, to throw more emotional energy behind it... that's a real problem."

"For all my education, accomplishments, and so called 'wisdom'... I can't fathom my own heart."
"Marriage is a blood sport. Marriage is jousting. It's disembowelment. It's just terrible, terrible visceral injuries. It's not for everybody."
"In terms of doing work and in terms of learning and evolving as a person, you just grow more when you get more people's perspectives... I really try and live the mission of the company and... keep everything else in my life extremely simple."
"Information is not knowledge, and knowledge is not wisdom. Reading - even browsing - an old book can yield sustenance denied by a database search. Patience is a virtue, gluttony a sin."
"It is no use saying, 'We are doing our best.' You have got to succeed in doing what is necessary."
"I like Diaspora because it's audacious, it's driven by passion, and it's very, very hard to do. After all, who in their right mind would set as a goal taking on Facebook? That's sort of like deciding to build a better search engine - very expensive, with a high likelihood of failure."
The love that comes from friendship is the underlying facet of a happy life.
"Psychology is much bigger than just medicine, or fixing unhealthy things. It's about education, work, marriage - it's even about sports. What I want to do is see psychologists working to help people build strengths in all these domains."
"Trump's biggest failure as a political leader is that he sees the worst in people, and he encourages the worst in people."
Some people are so busy learning the tricks of the trade that they never learn the trade.

"Just a little help, a small security force, a bit of food, can save lives."
"One of the funny things about the stock market is that every time one person buys, another sells, and both think they are astute."
"Overcoming fear is the first step to success for entrepreneurs. The winners all exemplify that, and the hard work and commitment they have shown underlines what is needed to set up a business."
"I am against marriage, and I don't give a fig for society."
"Scientists have shown that pigs are capable of playing simple video games, learning from each other, and even learning names."
"I think that big, sort of theatrical relaunches tend to set you up for failure and hype."
"Growing up, my dad owned a restaurant in Washington, DC, and food was something I was passionate about. But when I finally got into it, I felt like it was so late in the game; that's why I worked seven days a week at Craft and Mercer Kitchen. I wanted to see how far I could take it."
Wisdom is that apprehension of heavenly things to which the spirit rises through love.
Love: A temporary insanity curable by marriage.
Awards are not the only markers of success; I don't judge myself just based on them. I believe that each cinema-goer has his own mental trophies.
I didn't think marriage worked. I thought everybody who was married was secretly miserable - that it was something they just put up with for their children.
I think the fall in Eden was ultimately a failure to give thanks.

Love is the flower you've got to let grow.

Remember that stress doesn't come from what's going on in your life. It comes from your thoughts about what's going on in your life.
You are a product of your environment. So choose the environment that will best develop you toward your objective. Analyze your life in terms of its environment. Are the things around you helping you toward success - or are they holding you back?
An almost forgotten means of economic self-reliance is the home production of food. We are too accustomed to going to stores and purchasing what we need.
"There is no force like success, and that is why the individual makes all effort to surround himself throughout life with the evidence of it; as of the individual, so should it be of the nation."
"I think Donald Trump's interpretation of marriage is something that he himself doesn't really believe in. 'Traditional marriage' is where two people love each other, commit to each other, care for each other over the years. It is a meaningful ceremony, and his interpretation of that is not recognizing what real marriage is."
"My ideal night would probably be a dope outfit, people that I love around me. Go to get some dinner, have some amazing food. Maybe sushi or Italian: I love both."
"It is only the great hearted who can be true friends. The mean and cowardly, Can never know what true friendship means."

I don't understand a way to work other than bold-facedly running towards failure.

"Who is wise in love, love most, say least."
"Failure is not a single, cataclysmic event. You don't fail overnight. Instead, failure is a few errors in judgement, repeated every day."

There is no remedy for love but to love more.
In my life I've learned that true happiness comes from giving. Helping others along the way makes you evaluate who you are. I think that love is what we're all searching for. I haven't come across anyone who didn't become a better person through love.
A good husband is never the first to go to sleep at night or the last to awake in the morning.
"I've been blessed to be somebody that's been climbing that success mountain top for years of hard work, you know, but now it's all connecting. And now, the whole world is watching, you know what I'm saying, and it feels good 'cause it's good energy. This is all positive vibes, and good vibes and good energy, so it feels incredible."
It's lovely being a parent and being in a strong marriage with somebody who is your best friend.
A hatred of failure has always been part of my nature.
You've got to go out on a limb sometimes because that's where the fruit is.
"One might think that the money value of an invention constitutes its reward to the man who loves his work. But... I continue to find my greatest pleasure, and so my reward, in the work that precedes what the world calls success."
Life does not cease to be funny when people die any more than it ceases to be serious when people laugh.
The surest way to fail is not to determine to succeed.
"I love Chinese food, like steamed dim sum, and I can have noodles morning, noon and night, hot or cold. I like food that's very simple on the digestive system - I tend to keep it light. I love Japanese food too - sushi, sashimi and miso soup."
"I love to have a bath with beautiful, relaxing music on and have no rush to do anything. It's a wonderful indulgence, and it helps me to calm down and stop my mind running overtime."
"There is a growing literature about the multitude of journalism's problems, but most of it is concerned with the editorial side of the business, possibly because most people competent to write about journalism are not comfortable writing about finance."
The older I grow the more I distrust the familiar doctrine that age brings wisdom.
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies but also to hate his friends.
"I think, if you're in the United States, we've seen people trying to speak out in different ways and trying to make themselves heard about the United States' failure to move on generationally, given the long-festering wound of our history around race."
"I'd love for mental illness to be seen in the way that other horrible illnesses are. When people get cancer, very few parents will say, 'Oh I feel so bad for giving you so much unhealthy food over the years.'"
"He dares to be a fool, and that is the first step in the direction of wisdom."
"For as long as I can remember, I have wanted to be a godly person. Yet when I look at the yesterdays of my life, what I see, mostly, is a broken, irregular path littered with mistakes and failure. I have had temporary successes and isolated moments of closeness to God, but I long for the continuing presence of Jesus."
"I went to boarding school in the country, so there's no real differentiation between family and friends. I went there from when I was 8 until I was 17 - it was insane. If you earn my friendship, you are my family, and I'll do anything for you."
"Love is much nicer to be in than an automobile accident, a tight girdle, a higher tax bracket or a holding pattern over Philadelphia."
Small deeds done are better than great deeds planned.
"Barbecue is the good old technique of people making a fire and putting some stuff over the top - I mean, look at the S'more: it's just got a stick. A lot of those goofy toys, it's people who are looking at things to do. I think if you focus on the food, at the most you need tongs or a spoon to flip something; that's about it."
"Crime and bad lives are the measure of a State's failure, all crime in the end is the crime of the community."
"When I was first learning songs, I'd have a favorite song, and I'd take the chords and twist them around. I'd learn the chords and then play them backward. That was my first experimenting with writing a song."
"Leap, and the net will appear."
"When you print money, the money does not flow evenly into the economic system. It stays essentially in the financial service industry and among people that have access to these funds, mostly well-to-do people. It does not go to the worker."
"There was a time in the marriage when I could no longer look at myself in a mirror, couldn't feel I was a nice person. A bad relationship can do that, can make you doubt everything good you ever felt about yourself."

A little knowledge that acts is worth infinitely more than much knowledge that is idle.
"The philosophies of one age have become the absurdities of the next, and the foolishness of yesterday has become the wisdom of tomorrow."
"Food is everything we are. It's an extension of nationalist feeling, ethnic feeling, your personal history, your province, your region, your tribe, your grandma. It's inseparable from those from the get-go."
"I was never afraid of failure after that because, I think, coming that close to death you get kissed. With the years, the actual experience of course fades, but the flavor of it doesn't. I just had a real sense of what choice do I have but to live fully?"
I am the kind of person who really will drive hours for a bowl of chili. I'm not a three-star restaurant kind of a person; I'm just a food person.
A great secret of success is to go through life as a man who never gets used up.
You can preach a better sermon with your life than with your lips.
Only divine love bestows the keys of knowledge.
"I really believe that all of us have a lot of darkness in our souls. Anger, rage, fear, sadness. I don't think that's only reserved for people who have horrible upbringings. I think it really exists and is part of the human condition. I think in the course of your life you figure out ways to deal with that."
"The truth is that we can learn to condition our minds, bodies, and emotions to link pain or pleasure to whatever we choose. By changing what we link pain and pleasure to, we will instantly change our behaviors."
"My parents divorced when I was 3 years old. They had a lounge act in Las Vegas, where I was born. The band broke up and the marriage dissolved, and my mother, my sister and I moved to Southern California. And I didn't see my dad a lot growing up; he was on the road a lot. I'd see him every couple years."
The crime of loving is forgetting.
"I have a great love for cuisine, so I'm always interested in local food, and there are so many interesting dishes, spices and ingredients in India."
"Our most intimate friend is not he to whom we show the worst, but the best of our nature."
"We live in a fantasy world, a world of illusion. The great task in life is to find reality."
"Did I offer peace today? Did I bring a smile to someone's face? Did I say words of healing? Did I let go of my anger and resentment? Did I forgive? Did I love? These are the real questions. I must trust that the little bit of love that I sow now will bear many fruits, here in this world and the life to come."
There's no success story. Everybody's got a ghetto story. You always want to make it bigger than what it is.
"From the first I became convinced that what I must look for was lead dust and lead fumes, that men were poisoned by breathing poisoned air, not by handling their food with unwashed hands."
"As you are not yet married, and as marriage is the fundamental state of life as well as the unity of the commonwealth, make up your mind whether you are called to this state. If you make up your mind to marry, do not marry merely a good wife: marry a good mother to your children."
"It really helps to know what success is before you get there, and if you know, then you can head right for it. For some people, it's the most money. For some, it's the most power. For some, it's the most girlfriends. Everybody's got a measure. For me, I guess it's having the respect and admiration of your peers."
"Bad food is made without pride, by cooks who have no pride, and no love. Bad food is made by chefs who are indifferent, or who are trying to be everything to everybody, who are trying to please everyone... Bad food is fake food... food that shows fear and lack of confidence in people's ability to discern or to make decisions about their lives."
"Everyone knows in the industry that when these great roles come up, every two years, there's a huge number of people up for them. I'm not one of those top five females that can personally finance any film."
"Failure is a great teacher, and I think when you make mistakes and you recover from them and you treat them as valuable learning experiences, then you've got something to share."
"If we as a society are willing to have a preference for organic food, the farmer can pass on the savings."
A good husband makes a good wife.
What you do today can improve all your tomorrows.
"When you are young, do not get involved in steady dating. When you reach an age where you think of marriage, then is the time to become so involved."
"I have never denied my background or my culture. I have taught my child to embrace her Mexican heritage, to love my first language, Spanish, to learn about Mexican history, music, folk art, food, and even the Mexican candy I grew up with."
"Down on your knees, and thank heaven, fasting, for a good man's love."
"When I became finance minister, they called me Okonjo-Wahala - or 'Trouble Woman.' It means 'I give you hell.' But I don't care what names they call me. I'm a fighter; I'm very focused on what I'm doing, and relentless in what I want to achieve, almost to a fault. If you get in my way, you get kicked."
I know I'm guilty of and I think a lot of people are guilty of sort of getting starry-eyed with love and sort of looking over the bad things and keep going and you don't really prepare for how much work marriage really is.
You might well remember that nothing can bring you success but yourself.
"Marriage is the alliance of two people, one of whom never remembers birthdays and the other who never forgets them."
I think about food literally all day every day. It's a thing.

Today is your own. Tomorrow perchance may never come.
"If we can actually decrease the failure rate from nine out of 10 drugs failing in clinical trials and instead have seven out of 10 instead failing, that is a major victory for drug discovery and for people having better therapy."
Failure. It doesn't exist. 'Failure' is just what happens when we lose perspective.
"There is a land of the living and a land of the dead and the bridge is love, the only survival, the only meaning."
"If you don't ask, you don't get."
"Commitment, belief and positive attitude are all important if you're going to be a success, whether you're in sports, in business or, as in my case, anthropology."
"When I served as prime minister last time, I failed to prioritize my agenda. I was eager to complete everything at once, and ended my administration in failure. After resigning, for six years I traveled across the nation simply to listen."
"Hunting forces a person to endure, to master themselves, even to truly get to know the wild environment. Actually, along the way, hunting and fishing makes you fall in love with the natural world. This is why hunters so often give back by contributing to conservation."
"Food plays a large part in our weekend, but on a Friday evening, I'll make us something simple for tea. I might have a wee glass of wine."
"As long as you know yourself and you got good people around you and you passionate about what you do, that's all that matters because at the end of the day, you go to sleep with the people you love, you wake up with the people you love, and you spend your time with the people you love."
"If you would be loved, love, and be loveable."
"Feminism is dated? Yes, for privileged women like my daughter and all of us here today, but not for most of our sisters in the rest of the world who are still forced into premature marriage, prostitution, forced labor - they have children that they don't want or they cannot feed."
Life is like playing a violin solo in public and learning the instrument as one goes on.
"When you think of Yahoo, they had a shot to be what Vox is doing, in terms of taking content and distribution, and really focusing on news, sports, finance - the things that uniquely Yahoo was really terrific at - and really build that whole flywheel."
"By eating many fruits and vegetables in place of fast food and junk food, people could avoid obesity."
"The wisdom of the crowds has peaked. Web 3.0 is taking what we've built in Web 2.0 - the wisdom of the crowds - and putting an editorial layer on it of truly talented, compensated people to make the product more trusted and refined."
"Without sharks, you take away the apex predator of the ocean, and you destroy the entire food chain."
Friendship is one of the most tangible things in a world which offers fewer and fewer supports.
You can't build anything with a flimsy foundation. Friendship is the foundation.
"I used to pre-rehearse everything and then bring my pre-rehearsed performance to the set. Now, I'm learning to let it happen in the moment. American actors are much better at that than British actors. If I knew how to trust myself, I would have been much more relaxed."
"I realized I love motivating and I love empowering and I love inspiring people. I did that as an athlete for 18 years, and I am able to do that as a motivational speaker now as well as doing work on television."
"It's kind of major, learning to drive. I feel like it kicked up other stuff in my life."
A healthful hunger for a great idea is the beauty and blessedness of life.
"The common idea that success spoils people by making them vain, egotistic and self-complacent is erroneous; on the contrary it makes them, for the most part, humble, tolerant and kind."
"George Orwell's science-fiction classic 'Nineteen Eighty-Four' wasn't a failure because the future it predicted failed to come to pass. Rather, it was a resounding success because it helped us prevent that future."
"Lord, bless me with the ability to achieve all that I can, and the wisdom to realize it doesn't all have to be by tomorrow!"
The corporate right fires up the religious right against gay marriage and abortion and uses their votes to push their deregulation and tax cuts for the rich. It's an old trick. The House of Saud has the same arrangement with the Mullahs in Saudi Arabia.
"There is no friendship, no love, like that of the parent for the child."
I attribute my success to this - I never gave or took any excuse.
"Unconditional love really exists in each of us. It is part of our deep inner being. It is not so much an active emotion as a state of being. It's not 'I love you' for this or that reason, not 'I love you if you love me.' It's love for no reason, love without an object."
Determine that there will never be anything that will come between you that will disrupt your marriage. Make it work. Resolve to make it work.
"I'm just thankful for everything, all the blessings in my life, trying to stay that way. I think that's the best way to start your day and finish your day. It keeps everything in perspective."
"What is man's ultimate direction in life? It is to look for love, truth, virtue, and beauty."
A pair of powerful spectacles has sometimes sufficed to cure a person in love.

I decided to fly through the air and live in the sunlight and enjoy life as much as I could.
"Any man who has $10,000 left when he dies is a failure."
Love takes off masks that we fear we cannot live without and know we cannot live within.
"Honestly, I've learned from results, period. Everything isn't a failure. Sometimes it just doesn't work. That's not a failure. Maybe it just means it wasn't its time."
People don't notice whether it's winter or summer when they're happy.
It really is impossible not to like him. His success was his failure.
"Since music is so important to me, I don't need to put in any extra effort to do this; it just flows for me. It's as simple as drinking water and having food, so definitely, music is one of the main purposes of my life."
"The failure of one regional bank, assuming it is following a traditional model, will not threaten the entire system."
"I would love to take a cooking class from Gandhi. Maybe I could teach him how to cook, and he could teach me his message. I wouldn't mind learning how to make couscous from scratch from a North African woman, either."
"Never trust anyone completely but God. Love people, but put your full trust only in God."
This society in which we live is radically changing. What previous generations saw as evil is now embraced as being good. It is a dangerous and slippery slope upon which we stand when we reject what Solomon called the beginning of wisdom - the fear of God.
Change is the law of life. And those who look only to the past or present are certain to miss the future.
"I grew up going to public school, and they were huge public schools. I went to a school that had 3,200 kids, and I had grade school classes with 40-some kids. Discipline was rigid. Most of the learning was rote. It worked."
Ignorance and bungling with love are better than wisdom and skill without.
"For me, art is about learning and about living with people. It's alive."
"Why is marriage the pinnacle for everyone? People get married for the wrong reasons. We need to start looking at different packages, whether it's living together, or being with six partners, or dedicating your life to taking care of flowers."
"The care of human life and happiness, and not their destruction, is the first and only object of good government."
"If we listened to our intellect, we'd never have a love affair. We'd never have a friendship. We'd never go into business, because we'd be cynical. Well, that's nonsense. You've got to jump off cliffs all the time and build your wings on the way down."
"I'll never, ever be full. I'll always be hungry. Obviously, I'm not talking about food. Growing up, I had nothing for such a long time. Someone told me a long time ago, and I've never forgotten it, 'Once you've ever been hungry, really, really hungry, then you'll never, ever be full.'"
"In our fast-forward culture, we have lost the art of eating well. Food is often little more than fuel to pour down the hatch while doing other stuff - surfing the Web, driving, walking along the street. Dining al desko is now the norm in many workplaces. All of this speed takes a toll. Obesity, eating disorders and poor nutrition are rife."
He who devotes sixteen hours a day to hard study may become at sixty as wise as he thought himself at twenty.
"The hope is they would like to bring it to Broadway next year, so we'll see that's to come in the end of the finance year and everybody else and also real estate and what theaters are available at the time but I would like to come back with it."
"Until politicos take a true stand in defense of marriage by proposing an anti-adultery amendment to the Constitution, stop demonizing gays and lesbians when the one debasing your marriage is the individual in the mirror."
It's nice to know you have support. Last night I got a marriage proposal. I just laughed.
"Love planted a rose, and the world turned sweet."
Never tell people how to do things. Tell them what to do and they will surprise you with their ingenuity.
I have been very blessed in my life and rewarded with good friends and good health. I am grateful and happy to be able to share this.
There is a difference between happiness and wisdom: he that thinks himself the happiest man is really so; but he that thinks himself the wisest is generally the greatest fool.
I've accepted that I was a failure in politics. I was not qualified for the job.
Men always want to be a woman's first love - women like to be a man's last romance.
I would like to see people more aware of where their food comes from. I would like to see small farmers empowered. I feed my daughter almost exclusively organic food.
He who would learn to fly one day must first learn to stand and walk and run and climb and dance; one cannot fly into flying.
"English people don't have very good diction. In France you have to pronounce very particularly and clearly, and learning French at an early age helped me enormously."
"What has history said of eminence without honor, wealth without wisdom, power and possessions without principle? The answer is reiterated in the overthrow of the mightiest empires of ancient times. Babylon, Persia, Greece, Rome! The four successive, universal powers of the past. What and where are they?"
"I'm going to write a book, continue acting, continue motivational speaking and just share with people who I am and what I've learned in my second chance of life and pass it on to people in their first chance of life."
"Anyone who's a chef, who loves food, ultimately knows that all that matters is: 'Is it good? Does it give pleasure?'"
"I was not thinking about infinite multipliers when I was 10. But I did have a father who was a Ph.D. in commerce and finance and an intellectual man. And so I had a feeling, probably about the time I went to college, that I would try to be a scholar and teacher, but I didn't know which field."
"If you can't feed a hundred people, then feed just one."
Defeat may serve as well as victory to shake the soul and let the glory out.
"I've been on a team that won the world championship of barbecue. But barbecue's interesting, because it's one of these cult foods like chili, or bouillabaisse. Various parts of the world will have a cult food that people get enormously attached to - there's tremendous traditions; there's secrecy."
The art of living is more like wrestling than dancing.
We never know the love of a parent till we become parents ourselves.
Step by step and the thing is done.
"I did commit to myself that I would not jump back into being the workaholic that I can be before I gave myself an honest opportunity to create the marriage of my dreams and to create the beginning of the family of my dreams, and that took a hot second."
Intuition is the wisdom formed by feeling and instinct - a gift of knowing without reasoning... Belief is ignited by hope and supported by facts and evidence - it builds alignment and creates confidence. Belief is what sets energy in motion and creates the success that breeds more success.
"I don't really believe in diets. I love food... If I deprive myself, I'm going to want it more. I snack on yogurt, raw cashews and cherry tomatoes."
"Anytime you ride against the best in the world, it becomes a learning process."
"I have self-doubt. I have insecurity. I have fear of failure. I have nights when I show up at the arena and I'm like, 'My back hurts, my feet hurt, my knees hurt. I don't have it. I just want to chill.' We all have self-doubt. You don't deny it, but you also don't capitulate to it. You embrace it."
Love is when you meet someone who tells you something new about yourself.
"Public education must be viewed from the lens of providing each child with the learning environment that best meets his or her needs. If we can send a low-income child to a parochial school, knowing that his odds of attending college will increase as a result, then that should be our mission."
"I believe in capitalism for everybody, not necessarily high finance but capitalism that works for the working men and women of this country who are out there paddling alone in America right now."
"What do you actually need? Food, clothing and shelter. Everything else is entertainment."
Mental prayer in my opinion is nothing else than an intimate sharing between friends; it means taking time frequently to be alone with Him who we know loves us. The important thing is not to think much but to love much and so do that which best stirs you to love. Love is not great delight but desire to please God in everything.
"For marriage to be a success, every woman and every man should have her and his own bathroom. The end."
I would rather die a meaningful death than to live a meaningless life.
"If people want to believe that the organic food has better nutritive value, it's up to them to make that foolish decision. But there's absolutely no research that shows that organic foods provide better nutrition."
"The lack of access to proper nutrition is not only fueling obesity, it is leading to food insecurity and hunger among our children."
"Marriage is about love, but it is not first and foremost about love. First and foremost, marriage is about continuity and transmission."
"I learned to be a hot-air balloon pilot to take tourists over the Masai Mara Reserve in order to earn some money and finance the work I was doing with my wife, Anne. We were studying the life of a family of lions for more than two years. Taking pictures was a way to capture information we could not put in words."
"Hong Kong is a wonderful, mixed-up town where you've got great food and adventure. First and foremost, it's a great place to experience China in a relatively accessible way."
"What is marriage, is marriage protection or religion, is marriage renunciation or abundance, is marriage a stepping-stone or an end. What is marriage."
The most irresistible charm of youth is its bubbling enthusiasm. Youth sees no darkness ahead - no defile that has no outlet - it forgets that there is such a thing as failure in the world and believes that mankind has been waiting all these centuries for him to come and be the liberator of truth and energy and beauty.
"Good fiction is about asserting the beauties of the world, inventing a new, positive thing. Where am I going to get that? And it should be original; it should not be cliched. So the way I looked at history was not to accuse it of failure."
"One thing I learned particularly at Yale was how to work with others. Having studied so long trying to master myself, the biggest challenge was learning about the other person's work."

I can get motivated seeing a kid at my son's school overcome a learning disability.
"One should eat to live, not live to eat."
"I've got two young sons who, when I ask them and their friends how they feel about gay marriage, kinda give me one of those looks like, 'Gosh, Mom, why are you even asking that question?'"
"All those who offer an opinion on any doubtful point should first clear their minds of every sentiment of dislike, friendship, anger or pity."
"Talent alone won't make you a success. Neither will being in the right place at the right time, unless you are ready. The most important question is: 'Are your ready?'"
"The success of the Rat Pack or the Clan was due to the camaraderie, the three guys who work together and kid each other and love each other."
Success is the best revenge. I always feel women should answer back either with their sarcasm or success.

"Remember that a gesture of friendship, no matter how small, is always appreciated."
"I came to Venice for the first time in 1968 and was lucky enough to make the acquaintanceship, and then the friendship, of two Venetians, Roberta and Franco, who remain my best friends here after almost 50 years."
"Success comes to those who have an entire mountain of gold that they continually mine, not those who find one nugget and try to live on it for fifty years."
There can be no rise in the value of labour without a fall of profits.
It's okay to eat fish because they don't have any feelings.
"You look at any culture, and prohibition has invariably been an unmitigated failure. It is just idiotic to criminalise any substance, I think."
Success is falling nine times and getting up ten.

"I think it's way harder when you have success, 'cause people tend to not treat you the same or look at you the same because they see the success or the money you make."
"Children live in the only successful Marxist state ever created: the family. 'From each according to his ability, to each according to his need' is the family's practice as well as its theory. Even with today's scattershot patterns of marriage and parenting, a family is collectivist to a more than North Korean degree."
"Enjoy your sweat because hard work doesn't guarantee success, but without it you don't have a chance."
"I'm no expert. I have no psychic powers, and I sure don't possess any secret wisdom. I'm just Janet. I have strengths, weaknesses, fears, happiness, sadness. I experience joy and I experience pain. I'm highly emotional. I'm very vulnerable."
"Honesty and loyalty are key. If two people can be honest with each other about everything, that's probably the biggest key to success."

It provides us with the opportunity to get back to our foundational ideals, which have always stood as a beacon for the rest of the world."
We never understand how little we need in this world until we know the loss of it.
"Life is like dancing. If we have a big floor, many people will dance. Some will get angry when the rhythm changes. But life is changing all the time."
"It can be easy and tempting, especially during a presidential campaign, to listen only to opinions that mirror and fortify one's own. That's not ideal, because it eliminates learning and makes it impossible for people to understand what they dismiss as 'the other side.'"
"After learning the language and culture of the Chinese people, these Jesuits began to establish contacts with the young intellectuals of the country."
"The more man meditates upon good thoughts, the better will be his world and the world at large."

Who cares about great marks left behind? We have one life... just one. Our life. We have nothing else.
Jeff Bezos was one of those best and brightest who came to N.Y. to work in finance. He didn't need to know anything about retail bookselling to start Amazon.
"In romance, we feel the need to zoom in and expound on our partner's foibles in intimate detail; in friendship, we tend to do the opposite, avoiding confrontation through fear, lethargy or both."
I really just want to be warm yellow light that pours over everyone I love.
"You can never control who you fall in love with, even when you're in the most sad, confused time of your life. You don't fall in love with people because they're fun. It just happens."
"The table is a meeting place, a gathering ground, the source of sustenance and nourishment, festivity, safety, and satisfaction. A person cooking is a person giving: Even the simplest food is a gift."
"You really have to work hard and apply yourself and by applying yourself and working hard and being diligent, you can achieve success."

My wife is my soul mate. I can't imagine being without her.
"From dead plant matter to nematodes to bacteria, never underestimate the cleverness of mushrooms to find new food!"
"One of my earliest memories is of seeing my mother in her beach chair, reading a book under an umbrella by the water's edge while my sisters and I played beside her. Of all the life lessons she taught me, that is one of my favorites: to take time at a place I love, restore my spirit with books and the beach."
"You may lose your wife, you may lose your dog, your mother may hate you. None of those things matter. What matters is that you achieve success and become free. Then you can do whatever you like."
"Where fear is present, wisdom cannot be."
"We became friends as we became a band. Our friendship evolved as the band evolved. It had its ups and downs, but it was mostly ups for the four of us. We got along well almost all of the time. Hey! We liked each other and we still do."
The life of the dead is placed in the memory of the living.
"I went into rehab to save my marriage, but I wound up saving myself."
"When learning was monopolized by the monks in the Middle Ages, people specialized only in warfare and statecraft. And even these were not altogether free from the scholastic influence."
Although even when I am being idle I have plenty of food for thought both early and late - thoughts both about and not about art.
One of the reasons people stop learning is that they become less and less willing to risk failure.
Honesty is the best policy.
"I get asked, 'How can you have such failures in your films?' Well, what else is life about? There's some sense of constant failure in something. Humor gives you a distance from it."
The good life is one inspired by love and guided by knowledge.
"Outside of hip-hop, it was in comics that I most often found the aesthetics and wisdom of my world reflected."
"Learning to accept failure on multiple levels is, to my way of thinking, the key to become a world-class therapist. But that means humility, and setting your ego aside, while you develop superb new technical skills."

"I feel if I'm healthy and happy, I look good. With a good mixture of fitness and healthy food I always feel great!"

"There is a Fountain of Youth: It is your mind, your talents, the creativity you bring to your life and the lives of the people you love. When you learn to tap this source, you will truly have defeated age."
How one handles success or failure is determined by their early childhood.
How delightful to find a friend in everyone.
"The Conservatives are a confusing lot. They first denied climate change was a serious issue and then suggested strengthening the nuclear industry as a solution to it. They oppose the European Union, but support joining North American Free Trade Agreement, despite its obvious failure."
I don't date my girlfriend because she's a model. I date her because I love her.
"A man can be himself only so long as he is alone, and if he does not love solitude, he will not love freedom, for it is only when he is alone that he is really free."
"At this point, I don't get hired a lot because people don't think I could finance a movie."
"I don't like posh hotels. I like small, eclectic hotels, and luxury for me would mean really good company with good food in a really funky, beautiful house in the middle of a field where someone came and serviced the place for us."
"I think steak is the ultimate comfort food, and if you're going out for one, that isn't the time to scrimp on calories or quality."
I'm also interested in the modern suggestion that you can have a combination of love and sex in a marriage - which no previous society has ever believed.
"Keep your eyes wide open before marriage, half shut afterwards."
Success - keeping your mind awake and your desire asleep.
"That sense of failure, I don't know where people put it who don't write songs and aren't able to emote physically. It must go somewhere."
"In order to succeed, your desire for success should be greater than your fear of failure."
He is no fool who gives what he cannot keep to gain what he cannot lose.
"My family lived off the land and summer evening meals featured baked stuffed tomatoes, potato salad, corn on the cob, fresh shelled peas and homemade ice cream with strawberries from our garden. With no air conditioning in those days, the cool porch was the center of our universe after the scorching days."
Ambition is the path to success. Persistence is the vehicle you arrive in.
Ego is certainly there in many of the greatest and most dizzying tales of success - but it's there in some of the greatest stories of failure and self-implosion as well.
"I've always loved music, but I never really played anything. After 'Walk the Line' and learning to play guitar, and having that sense of performing, I think that certainly opened the door for me, for music."
"Marriage, n: the state or condition of a community consisting of a master, a mistress, and two slaves, making in all, two."
The main failure of education is that it has not prepared people to comprehend matters concerning human destiny.
"The government shouldn't be involved in this because it's very simple. If you don't believe in same-sex marriage, then don't marry somebody of the same sex."
The indispensable first step to getting the things you want out of life is this: decide what you want.
"You have enemies? Good. That means you've stood up for something, sometime in your life."
Success is simply a matter of luck. Ask any failure.
I'm learning how to keep my identity and personal life sacred. It's a matter of knowing my limits. I don't have to give everything that's asked of me.
"I like to think of my behavior in the sixties as a 'learning experience.' Then again, I like to think of anything stupid I've done as a 'learning experience.' It makes me feel less stupid."
"When you're building a company, you need to continually strengthen every component - finance, strategic partnerships, executive team, and relationships with every last constituency."
"I'm so wrapped up in my work that it's often impossible to consider other things in my life. My marriage ended in divorce because of this, my relationship with Holly has suffered by this."
"Even a happy life cannot be without a measure of darkness, and the word happy would lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness. It is far better take things as they come along with patience and equanimity."
"There's great food everywhere, and even McDonald's uses nice wood now."
Indecision and delays are the parents of failure.
"Being on the road is no excuse for having a poor diet. I don't like fast food, but if I have to, I'll order three plain grilled chicken sandwiches and throw out the buns."
"The attributes for entrepreneurs cut both ways. You need the ability to ignore inconvenient facts and see the world as it should be and not as it is. This inspires people to take huge leaps of faith. But this blindness to facts can be a liability, too. The characteristics that help entrepreneurs succeed can also lead to their failure."
I feel like I have a new life and I'm going to take full advantage of it.
"I like to be lazy. I do like to be busy and really active, but when that's done, you can be sure I will be a lazy boy. I like to take time and relax and enjoy life."
You cannot have a positive life and a negative mind.
"I'm not hungry for success. I am only hungry for good work, and that is how it is with most superstars. Every day I tell myself how fortunate I am to be where I am."
Everyone is handed adversity in life. No one's journey is easy. It's how they handle it that makes people unique.
"Before everything else, getting ready is the secret of success."
"Even if you're on the right track, you'll get run over if you just sit there."
"Success is a wonderful thing, but it tends not to be the sort of experience that we learn from. We enjoy it; perhaps we even deserve it. But we don't acquire wisdom from it."
"I was raised by a single mother who made a way for me. She used to scrub floors as a domestic worker, put a cleaning rag in her pocketbook and ride the subways in Brooklyn so I would have food on the table. But she taught me as I walked her to the subway that life is about not where you start, but where you're going. That's family values."
"Learning sleeps and snores in libraries, but wisdom is everywhere, wide awake, on tiptoe."
"Lots of people want to ride with you in the limo, but what you want is someone who will take the bus with you when the limo breaks down."
"I am not into marriage. You look at all the marriages breaking down and all the people cheating on their marriages, and you become cynical. Marriage is nothing but a label."
I finally know what distinguishes man from the other beasts: financial worries.
"Practical wisdom is only to be learned in the school of experience. Precepts and instruction are useful so far as they go, but, without the discipline of real life, they remain of the nature of theory only."
"However difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at."
"I'm fully aware that things that resonate and become real hits are the exception to the rule, so much so that I've wired myself for failure."
"I think if you just eat healthy, you're active, and you don't beat yourself up, you're setting yourself up to win rather than setting yourself up for failure."

Scholastic learning and polemical divinity retarded the growth of all true knowledge.
"Every meal should end with something sweet. Maybe it's jelly on toast at breakfast, or a small piece of chocolate at dinner - but it always helps my brain bring a close to the meal."
"Life changes when you have a child, when you have your own family. You become more careful about what you do. You're not going to be out late, going out to clubs, hanging out with your friends. You're going to be at home, taking care of your daughter, playing with her."
"Infosys demonstrated to the world that an Indian company could implement standards of quality, operations, finance that compare with the best. That is a legacy I am happy with."
"Success is not a good teacher, failure makes you humble."
"I am aware that as an actor, I can blame others for the failure of a film, the director, the script, choice of co-stars, timing of the release and so on. But now, as the director, I will have to shoulder all the blame."
"Without community service, we would not have a strong quality of life. It's important to the person who serves as well as the recipient. It's the way in which we ourselves grow and develop."
Your diet is a bank account. Good food choices are good investments.
"A friendship can weather most things and thrive in thin soil; but it needs a little mulch of letters and phone calls and small, silly presents every so often - just to save it from drying out completely."
You can always tell a real friend: when you've made a fool of yourself he doesn't feel you've done a permanent job.
"There's enormous progressive activism and, more often than not, success at the grassroots level - everything from living wage campaigns to efforts to finance our elections are having terrific success."
"Never be afraid to meet to the hilt the demand of either work, or friendship - two of life's major assets."
"To say that a work of art is good, but incomprehensible to the majority of men, is the same as saying of some kind of food that it is very good but that most people can't eat it."
Never order food in excess of your body weight.
"The less food, the more time to talk, the more to talk about."
"People are roasting each other at parties, at work events, around the fire. It's so fun. People are busting each other's chops, and it's a sign of affection, truly. It's a true test of love and friendship: can you make a man laugh at himself? So what makes a good burn? Go after targets you love and respect. And hit 'em hard."
"Marriage is this grand madness, and I think if people knew that, they would perhaps take it more seriously."
Failure too is a form of death.
"It is impossible to preserve my friendship with people who are allegedly leaders when they are attacking their own people, shooting at them, using tanks and other forms of heavy weaponry."
The price of every thing rises and falls from time to time and place to place; and with every such change the purchasing power of money changes so far as that thing goes.
"'Survivor' wouldn't have happened had I not gone out there and helped CBS to sell sponsors to finance the first one. Part of my thinking on 'Survivor' was that it should have rewards that are corporate brands. A Big Mac, one thimble-full of Coca-Cola."
My work has also motivated me to put a lot of time into seeking out good food and to spend more money on it.
"Morality comes with the sad wisdom of age, when the sense of curiosity has withered."
A successful marriage is an edifice that must be rebuilt every day.
"The deep learning techniques, while relatively easy to learn, are quite foreign to traditional engineering modalities. It takes a different mindset and a relaxation of the presumption of control. The practitioners are like magi, sequestered from the rest of a typical engineering process."
"I have never in my life found myself in a situation where I've stopped work and said, 'Thank God it's Friday.' But weekends are special even if your schedule is all over the place. Something tells you the weekend has arrived and you can indulge yourself a bit."
Spending two years on my uncle's ranch in Montana as a young man gave me the wisdom and the thrust to do westerns.

"The man who has done his level best... is a success, even though the world may write him down a failure."
"The secret to success is good leadership, and good leadership is all about making the lives of your team members or workers better."
"Life is short and we have never too much time for gladdening the hearts of those who are travelling the dark journey with us. Oh be swift to love, make haste to be kind."
"Performers should really go to the best schools, like Lady Gaga, you know, she went to NYU and had great teachers... It's best to really study your technique as much as you possibly can so you can have a long career instead of a quick one that's a failure."
"As Michigan's voice on the Senate Finance Committee and Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I will continue working to make sure the next generation of advanced technologies and alternative fuel vehicles are made right here in America."
Fear of failure must never be a reason not to try something.
"A friend at school was always being laughed at because his father emptied dustbins for a living. But those who laughed worshipped famous footballers. This is an example of our topsy-turvy view of 'success.' Who would we miss most if they did not work for a month, the footballer or the garbage collector?"
The advantage of age is that you swap youth for wisdom. You're so full of insecurities when you're young. 'Who am I? What do I have to do for people to like me?' You get caught up in things. You get very emotional about things.
Your sacred space is where you can find yourself again and again.
"The rare few, who, early in life have rid themselves of the friendship of the many."
Success is getting what you want. Happiness is liking what you get.
Things are never quite as scary when you've got a best friend.
"I cherish the memory of being a friend of Frank Sinatra on a friendship level to the point where we really hung out. We worked in Vegas, we'd talk on the phone, and if I wasn't doing anything, I'd fly out, and I spent time in Palm Springs at his house - on a level the way friends would be, not with a whole crowd of people."
"In the future, I want a movie career, kids and a happy marriage."
"I tend to split my activities into fun, income and legacy. The number of things in that finance bucket is pretty few and far between and doesn't consume much time at all."
"Wisdom is the right use of knowledge. To know is not to be wise. Many men know a great deal, and are all the greater fools for it. There is no fool so great a fool as a knowing fool. But to know how to use knowledge is to have wisdom."
"Wisdom we know is the knowledge of good and evil, not the strength to choose between the two."
"I was very afraid of failure because if you fail at something you love, then you ruin what you love."
"For market discipline to constrain risk effectively, financial institutions must be allowed to fail. Under optimal financial regulatory and financial system infrastructures, such a failure would not threaten the overall system."
"There has to be innate circuitry that does the learning, that creates the culture, that acquires the culture, and that responds to socialization."
"When a friend is in trouble, don't annoy him by asking if there is anything you can do. Think up something appropriate and do it."

A loving heart is the truest wisdom.
The things that have been most valuable to me I did not learn in school.
I am for gay marriage. Or same-sex marriage. I don't want to say it the wrong way. I think people are sensitive to it. I have been painted as being this right-wing zealot on choice. Nothing could be further from the truth.
Entrepreneurship is like a computer game in which you have to master every level before achieving success. Startups repeatedly stumble and have to go back to the drawing board. The best way to skip some levels and to increase the odds of survival is to learn from others who have already played the game.
The way most people fail is in not keeping up the heart.
"We learn differently as children than as adults. For grown-ups, learning a new skill is painful, attention-demanding, and slow. Children learn unconsciously and effortlessly."
Maybe all one can do is hope to end up with the right regrets.
"I'm in love with red. I think it's such a passionate color. Every flag of every country pretty much has red it it. It's power, there's no fence sitting with red. Either you love it or you don't.

"Pain and foolishness lead to great bliss and complete knowledge, for Eternal Wisdom created nothing under the sun in vain."
My best friend is the man who in wishing me well wishes it for my sake.

New York is about success. Boston is about resentment.

The noblest pleasure is the joy of understanding.
Beware of little expenses. A small leak will sink a great ship.
"Variety is what I would recommend: As variety is the spice of life in food, so it is in exercise. Change it up. But most of all, don't overdo it."
"Online education, then, can serve two goals. For students lucky enough to have access to great teachers, blended learning can mean even better outcomes at the same or lower cost. And for the millions here and abroad who lack access to good, in-person education, online learning can open doors that would otherwise remain closed."
"Historically, defense spending cuts have preceded increased international turmoil as America's global enemies sense a failure of will."
"Even if you fall on your face, you're still moving forward."
"There's no way to become great overnight, but in the marathon of success, it takes a lot of intention to see you through each day of the journey."
"From a public perspective, the Grand National is the biggest race of all, and not to have won it yet is definitely a failure. But there's been a lot of jockeys every bit as good and better than me that haven't won it - John Francome, Peter Scudamore, Jonjo O'Neill, Charlie Swan, to name a few."
"I have no companion but Love, no beginning, no end, no dawn. The Soul calls from within me: 'You, ignorant of the way of Love, set Me free.'"
"I have come close to producing films. But generally by the time they hit the screen, there's about 50 people with producer credits, so what's the point. I usually find scripts I like with no money attached and take them to producers that I know and try to raise finance."
"The secret of life is honesty and fair dealing. If you can fake that, you've got it made."
"Life is a series of experiences, each one of which makes us bigger, even though sometimes it is hard to realize this. For the world was built to develop character, and we must learn that the setbacks and grieves which we endure help us in our marching onward."
"My formula for living is quite simple. I get up in the morning and I go to bed at night. In between, I occupy myself as best I can."

"The 1 to 2 billion poorest in the world, who don't have food for the day, suffer from the worst disease: globalization deficiency. The way globalization is occurring could be much better, but the worst thing is not being part of it. For those people, we need to support good civil societies and governments."
"After two decades of personal finance reporting, I've heard every excuse in the book for not saving money. That said, none of them really hold up - at least over the long term."
"Life is bigger than cinema. Cinema is just a part of life, so I never take success or failure seriously."
"God wants us to know that life is a series of beginnings, not endings. Just as graduations are not terminations, but commencements. Creation is an ongoing process, and when we create a perfect world where love and compassion are shared by all, suffering will cease."
"I will never forget experiencing Venice for the first time. It feels like you are transported to another time - the art, music, food and pure romance in the air is like no other place."

"When I travel I normally eat club sandwiches or I bring my own food. When you go into a new town, it's very had to find a good place to eat."

"White America is tortured by black America's failure to thrive, and all that guilt and anxiety has only gotten worse as a substantial quota of white America loses its own footing in the middle class and plunges into the rough country of joblessness, hopelessness, and government dependency."
"If you reject the food, ignore the customs, fear the religion and avoid the people, you might better stay at home."
"The willingness to keep learning is, I think, the most important thing about trying to be good at anything. You never want to stop learning."
"I love food, all types of food. I love Korean food, Japanese, Italian, French. In Australia, we don't have a distinctive Australian food, so we have food from everywhere all around the world. We're very multicultural, so we grew up with lots of different types of food."
"There are two ways to extend a business. Take inventory of what you're good at and extend out from your skills. Or determine what your customers need and work backward, even if it requires learning new skills. Kindle is an example of working backward."
"Everything has been figured out, except how to live."
"I learned very early that our health is always impaired by some excess either of food or abstinence, and I never had any physician except myself."
"If you look on Amazon - if you do a search for personal finance, there are literally 20,000 books written on personal finance, and there's no real reason for it. I mean, personal finance is pretty simple."
A word of encouragement from a teacher to a child can change a life. A word of encouragement from a spouse can save a marriage. A word of encouragement from a leader can inspire a person to reach her potential.
He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life.
"Fighting for one's freedom, struggling towards being free, is like struggling to be a poet or a good Christian or a good Jew or a good Muslim or good Zen Buddhist. You work all day long and achieve some kind of level of success by nightfall, go to sleep and wake up the next morning with the job still to be done. So you start all over again."
A man begins cutting his wisdom teeth the first time he bites off more than he can chew.
That is why I fought against abortion and that is why if I were still in the Senate I would be doing everything I could to defend the sanctity of marriage.
Love is like a virus. It can happen to anybody at any time.
"Do what you love to do and give it your very best. Whether it's business or baseball, or the theater, or any field. If you don't love what you're doing and you can't give it your best, get out of it. Life is too short. You'll be an old man before you know it."
He was a bold man that first ate an oyster.
"Few are there that will leave the secure seclusion of the scholar's life, the peaceful walks of literature and learning, to stand out a target for the criticism of unkind and hostile minds."
"Friendship is the complete explanation of what a Cheetah Girl is - if you have that true friendship, you can conquer anything you want."
"One of the advantages of having gone to Penn State was having had a scholar for a mentor - Philip Young. Also, a professional writer named Philip Klass taught there. He was a science fiction writer whose pseudonym was William Tenn. As a professional writer, he brought wisdom to teaching because he'd done it for a living."
A kiss is a rosy dot over the 'i' of loving.

Young players need freedom of expression to develop as creative players... they should be encouraged to try skills without fear of failure.
"Perfect happiness would be knowing that all my family and friends were happy and safe.

"Aim for the moon. If you miss, you may hit a star."
I have seen life from the top down and the bottom up. I know how it looks both ways. And I know there is wisdom and that there is hope.
"When I do a 30-minute meal, for instance, on Food Network, that's my food you see at the end of the show and it's not perfect. And if sometimes things break or drop or the pasta hits the wall when I'm draining it, they never stop tape. They just kind of let me go with it."
We are already producing enough food to feed the world. We already have technology in place that allows us to produce more than we can find a market for.

"The censors have always had a field day with James Joyce, specifically with 'Ulysses,' but also with his other writings.

I have always thought that what the critics hated and feared about Joyce is his cry for human freedom."

"My philosophy is it's none of my business what people say of me and think of me. I am what I am, and I do what I do. I expect nothing and accept everything. And it makes life so much easier."

"Lord knows, every day is not a success, every year is not a success. You have to celebrate the good."
This is the paradox for me: in failure alone is there any possibility of success. I don't think I'm alone in this - nor do I think it's an attitude that only prevails among people whose work is obviously 'creative'.
"I'm not perfect. I'm never going to be. And that's the great thing about living the Christian life and trying to live by faith, is you're trying to get better every day. You're trying to improve."

What you get by achieving your goals is not as important as what you become by achieving your goals.
"There are times, like after a long day of work, when the thought of an easy drive-through is enticing. But then I remember how crappy I felt when I ate fast food in the past, and it inspires me to head to the grocery store or my local farmer's market and whip up an easy but healthier option."
"I love Rauschenberg. I love that he created a turning point in visual history, that he redefined the idea of beauty, that he combined painting, sculpture, photography, and everyday life with such gall, and that he was interested in, as he put it, 'the ability to conceive failure as progress.'"

"I'm not for gay marriage, but I'm not for discriminating against people."

"True friendship is a plant of slow growth, and must undergo and withstand the shocks of adversity, before it is entitled to the appellation."
"You build on failure. You use it as a stepping stone. Close the door on the past. You don't try to forget the mistakes, but you don't dwell on it. You don't let it have any of your energy, or any of your time, or any of your space."
"You just hope that you will get the opportunity to do what you love and pay your bills, and that is being a success as an actor."
"When you come from a big family, you see that, growing up, you're learning how to share. Your sisters have got your back; you're not alone in this - 'We all support you!' Your family provides that; it gives you a sense of safety, and it's a very grounding feeling."
"The experience of being cared for is profound, and it nourishes the soul as much as the food does the body."

"Life is like an onion. You peel it off one layer at a time, and sometimes you weep."
"Treat failure as a lesson on how not to approach achieving a goal, and then use that learning to improve your chances of success when you try again. Failure is only the end if you decide to stop."
"I made an awful mess of my first marriage. It was hard to live with me being me. I was so abnormal. I mean, most writers struggle. I hadn't struggled.

A rejection is nothing more than a necessary step in the pursuit of success.
"I want to see success right away. And I want to never give up, never stop."

"In 1973, women got 59 cents on the dollar; now we are getting 74 cents on the dollar. In the area of finance and business, we are at 68 cents on the dollar."
"Learning lessons is a little like reaching maturity. You're not suddenly more happy, wealthy, or powerful, but you understand the world around you better, and you're at peace with yourself.

"Remember the two benefits of failure. First, if you do fail, you learn what doesn't work; and second, the failure gives you the opportunity to try a new approach."

"When two kids are being completely berserk, and they're naked and throwing food around, sometimes I just let it go because I can see a future where they're going to be dressed, and they're going to be at school. So I kind of let stuff go sometimes."

"If you have the insight of non-self, if you have the insight of impermanence, you should make that insight into a concentration that you keep alive throughout the day.

However, not just any air will do - it must be exquisitely designed to meet our needs. Too little oxygen in the atmosphere will kill us, as will too much."
"Successful people have a bigger fear of failure than people who've never done anything because if you haven't been successful, then you don't know how it feels to lose it all. You don't have that fear. So why do you think people get stuck in those boxes? It's that fear of going back down."
"We created a line of pet food called Nutrish that's made to human standards, and 100 percent of the proceeds go to animal rescue. One of our top-tier donors is the ASPCA, and they help us challenge animal shelters all across the country to get more animals placed in homes."

"I would have thought that I would have become one of those parents - just because it's my nature to be such a perfectionist - that anything falling short, I would have seen as a failure. But something has happened to me over the past few years - it's not Zen, believe me, I'm not at all Zen - but I'm so appreciative of even the chaos."
"I despise shows that present friendship where you're always there for each other and really strong because I don't know anyone like that. I mean, I've got great friends, but I can go months without seeing them because I think, 'I just can't deal with having to give you anything.'"

"Essentially what's going to determine how you succeed in New York is how people feel about the space, how delicious the food is, how they perceive the value and, most important of all, how they feel treated.

I am simply trying to struggle through life; trying to do God's bidding.
"When you don't have access to a subject, and all you have is ex-members and critics, there is this gravitational pull toward telling a certain version of events.

"In the old days we were the challenger brand competing against the big banks, but today I go round the world and I sit with governors of central banks and finance ministers and, in some cases, prime ministers.

Love is the greatest gift that God has given us. It's free.
"The state's interest in marriage is stability. Generally speaking, polygamy does not work for stability. Inherent in the whole polygamous movement is a deep and abiding misogyny and denigration of women. So polygamy is objectionable on lots of grounds."
Friendship is Love without his wings!
"I'm just going to go live life. I'm going to go enjoy life. I have nothing left to hide. I am kind of a free person, a free soul."

Health food makes me sick.
"I realise that I do not change the course of history. I am an actor, I do a movie, that's the end of it. You have to realise we are just clowns for hire. After I had success it was great, at first, not to worry about money. It was on my mind when I was growing up."
I think the way to keep a friendship is to respect that everybody is different.

"I've never understood why we would want to deny all the joys - and the challenges - of marriage to anyone. Which is why I think any loving, committed couple - gay or straight - should be able to get married."

"Measuring success in cultural diplomacy - the use of education, creative expression in any form, or people-to-people exchange to increase understanding across regions, cultures, or peoples - is challenging.

Love can sometimes be magic. But magic can sometimes... just be an illusion.
"Learn to enjoy every minute of your life. Be happy now. Don't wait for something outside of yourself to make you happy in the future. Think how really precious is the time you have to spend, whether it's at work or with your family. Every minute should be enjoyed and savored."

The secret of a happy marriage is finding the right person. You know they're right if you love to be with them all the time.
Mistakes are the usual bridge between inexperience and wisdom.

I don't know that you're able to measure your aggregate wisdom as you go through life. I can't say that I ever feel that I'm sitting on top of a growing mound of wisdom.

"Feelings aroused by the touch of someone's hand, the sound of music, the smell of a flower, a beautiful sunset, a work of art, love, laughter, hope and faith - all work on both the unconscious and the conscious aspects of the self, and they have physiological consequences as well."

China has been committed to the independent foreign policy of peace and has developed friendship and cooperation with all countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

"I am not someone who is ashamed of my past. I'm actually really proud. I know I made a lot of mistakes, but they, in turn, were my life lessons."

"One life is all we have and we live it as we believe in living it. But to sacrifice what you are and to live without belief, that is a fate more terrible than dying."

Whatever is done for love always occurs beyond good and evil.
"If bigots oppose gay marriage so vehemently, it must be because marriage is a defining institution for them; gays will never be fully accepted until they can marry and adopt, like anyone else."

"I'm happy to be on a winning team. My individual success, that lasts for a short period of time. The success of being a part of the South, of Atlanta, which is now the hot bed of music, that's what's gonna last the longest. The fact that I contributed to planting our flag and moving music to my city, that's what I'm most proud of."

"But marriage goes in waves. You've got to be patient. People bail and give up on their marriages way too early. They just don't put the work and the effort into it. You've got to suck up your ego a lot of times, because that can be a big downfall."
It is often said that before you die your life passes before your eyes. It is in fact true. It's called living.

It has nothing to do with God or feelings or the romantic side of marriage. It's about who owns what, who gets what? So what's the point?"
Few things tend more to alienate friendship than a want of punctuality in our engagements. I have known the breach of a promise to dine or sup to break up more than one intimacy.

"I think you can have 10,000 explanations for failure, but no good explanation for success."
"For me, the perfect romantic suspense hero has got to be tough on the outside but tender at his core. A take-charge kind of guy who has his own inner strength and a strong sense of right and wrong - which might not dovetail with the conventional wisdom. I mean, he might bend the law if he thinks the ends justify the means."
"If we listened to our intellect, we'd never have a love affair. We'd never have a friendship. We'd never go into business, because we'd be cynical. Well, that's nonsense. You've got to jump off cliffs all the time and build your wings on the way down."

"There are three constants in life... change, choice and principles."

"Yoga is the most boring exercise. It's for people who are too lazy to get on the elliptical. Bikram, where they heat up the room to mimic India's climate, is especially stupid. People in India are not skinny because they're doing yoga in 105-degree rooms; they're skinny because there's no food."

"It's hard to imagine anything more interesting than learning how we're woven into the enormous tapestry of existence. Where did our universe come from? How special is our world, and how special are we? We allocate tens of billions of dollars annually to NASA, NSF and academia in search of the answers."
"Life is very, very short, and you can choose to live it how you want. You can choose to dumb yourself down and not express yourself just so you can fit in, just so people won't dislike you."

"Learning by doing, peer-to-peer teaching, and computer simulation are all part of the same equation."
"Typically, if you reward something, you get more of it. You punish something, you get less of it. And our businesses have been built for the last 150 years very much on that kind of motivational scheme."
"I think the most important thing in life is self-love, because if you don't have self-love, and respect for everything about your own body, your own soul, your own capsule, then how can you have an authentic relationship with anyone else?"
"Learning to read and write changes lives; it means jobs, money, health, and dreams fulfilled."

I want to dip my foot in some acting. And most definitely want to mentor upcoming artists and give them the wisdom that was given to me.
"My favorite time of day is to get up and eat leftovers from dinner, especially spicy food."
"Hurricane Katrina overwhelmed levees and exploded the conventional wisdom about a shared American prosperity, exposing a group of people so poor they didn't have $50 for a bus ticket out of town. If we want to learn something from this disaster, the lesson ought to be: America's poor deserve better than this."
"Cynicism masquerades as wisdom, but it is the furthest thing from it. Because cynics don't learn anything. Because cynicism is a self-imposed blindness: a rejection of the world because we are afraid it will hurt us or disappoint us. Cynics always say 'no.' But saying 'yes' begins things. Saying 'yes' is how things grow."
I think there's so much negative influence on children in school settings. It becomes learning by rote to pass a test. It's not contextualized.
To establish true self-esteem we must concentrate on our successes and forget about the failures and the negatives in our lives.
"We may not know what each day has in store for us. We could be gone tomorrow. Any minute could truly be our goodbye. But we do have this moment. This time. Today. Right now. It takes way more effort to shell out hate then it does to allow love to flow freely in our lives. After all, it's what we were born to do."
"The fact is that love is of two kinds, one which commands, and one which obeys. The two are quite distinct, and the passion to which the one gives rise is not the passion of the other."
"Marriage is like life - it is a field of battle, not a bed of roses."
"I want to keep learning, keep exploring, keep doing more."
"There are no mistakes, save one: the failure to learn from a mistake."
"I love to cook comfort food. I'll make fish and vegetables or meat and vegetables and potatoes or rice. The ritual of it is fun for me, and the creativity of it."
"Between men and women there is no friendship possible. There is passion, enmity, worship, love, but no friendship."
"Is there any possibility of giving international air travel, which we all need and use and hate, a touch of glamour, or even of reliable, soulless efficiency? I suspect future historians will puzzle over our failure. But by then, of course, we shall be in the age of mass space travel, with its fresh and unimaginable crop of horrors."
"I love spending time with my friends and family. The simplest things in life give me the most pleasure: cooking a good meal, enjoying my friends."
"I like to add props to render the specificities of place - paintings, food, clothing, signs, infrastructure, music, sayings and slang particular to the region and particular to the character. And props shouldn't just sit there; they should get used."
"When we long for life without difficulties, remind us that oaks grow strong in contrary winds and diamonds are made under pressure."
"All, everything that I understand, I understand only because I love."
"We all have a childhood dream that when there is love, everything goes like silk, but the reality is that marriage requires a lot of compromise."
Your most unhappy customers are your greatest source of learning.
Food simply isn't important to me.
The nice thing about being a writer is that you can make magic happen without learning tricks.
"Before marriage, a man declares that he would lay down his life to serve you; after marriage, he won't even lay down his newspaper to talk to you."

Marriage is a mistake every man should make.
"Not life, but good life, is to be chiefly valued."
"Success didn't spoil me, I've always been insufferable."
"The most effective leaders are actually better at guarding against danger when they acknowledge it that it exists. Cowards, in contrast, cling to the hope that failure will never happen and may be sloppy in the face of danger - not because they don't acknowledge that it exists, but because they are just too afraid of it to look it in the eye."
"I think I can hold every portfolio - defense, finance and Foreign Ministry. I think personally I'd like the foreign office."
Do the difficult things while they are easy and do the great things while they are small. A journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step.
Remember that creating a successful marriage is like farming: you have to start over again every morning.
"When you realize who the good people are in your life, you're so lucky."
"The number of stressors has multiplied exponentially: traffic, money, success, work/life balance, the economy, the environment, parenting, family conflict, relationships, disease. As the nature of human life has become far more complicated, our ancient stress response hasn't been able to keep up."
There's a way to do it better - find it.
"No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life's change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new."
"Thoughtless risks are destructive, of course, but perhaps even more wasteful is thoughtless caution which prompts inaction and promotes failure to seize opportunity."
You are always learning; there is a lot of grey; don't take things for granted.
I personally always find something really scary about watching little girls learning to manipulate their dads by baby talking. Then they grow up and use the same technique on their boyfriends or husbands. That scares me because it's just so sick on so many levels.
"If I'm making a movie and get hungry, I call time-out and eat some crackers."
"As governor, I enjoy the opportunity to talk about Utah's measurable business success."
Love is stronger than justice.
There is no surprise more magical than the surprise of being loved: It is God's finger on man's shoulder.
"Never give up, for that is just the place and time that the tide will turn."
"If at first you don't succeed, failure may be your style."
A wedding is a funeral where you smell your own flowers.
The most important thing for a good marriage is to learn how to argue peaceably.
It was my father who taught me to value myself. He told me that I was uncommonly beautiful and that I was the most precious thing in his life.
"I love food. I mean, I really love food. I take pictures of my finest, funniest and most fascinating dishes, post them on Twitter, and send them to friends. I treat menus like classic literature, refusing to skip even one word. I read the description of every item, regardless of whether or not I'm interested in eating it."
"Love feels no burden, thinks nothing of trouble, attempts what is above its strength, pleads no excuse of impossibility; for it thinks all things lawful for itself, and all things possible."
"I live in a country where music has very little success, though, exclusive of those who have forsaken us, we have still admirable professors and, more particularly, composers of great solidity, knowledge, and taste."
I was never given any hand-outs. I started at the bottom and was very good at finding people who knew more than me and learning from them.
"War is something Arafat sends others to do for him. That is, the poor souls who believe in him. This pompous incompetent caused the failure of the Camp David negotiations, Clinton's mediation."
No one who achieves success does so without acknowledging the help of others. The wise and confident acknowledge this help with gratitude.
"Where there is charity and wisdom, there is neither fear nor ignorance."
"He has achieved success who has worked well, laughed often, and loved much."
Food is celebratory. People who don't cook don't know how much fun they're missing.

"Life's short. Anything could happen, and it usually does, so there is no point in sitting around thinking about all the ifs, ands and buts."

"The truth is you don't know what is going to happen tomorrow. Life is a crazy ride, and nothing is guaranteed."
I feel that marriage can lead to the ultimate rejection and failure and divorce and things we all fear.
"I love, but I am not entirely sure how to be loved: how to be seen and known for the utterly flawed woman I am. It demands surrender. It demands acknowledging that I am not perfect, but perhaps I deserve affection anyway."
"Throughout life people will make you mad, disrespect you and treat you bad. Let God deal with the things they do, cause hate in your heart will consume you too."
"There are 30,000 days in your life. When I was 24, I realized I'm almost 9,000 days down. There are no warm-ups, no practice rounds, no reset buttons. Your biggest risk isn't failing, it's getting too comfortable. Every day, we're writing a few more words of a story. I wanted my story to be an adventure and that's made all the difference."
I love good food and I love to eat in nice restaurants. I love Japanese food. I love Gordon Ramsay in London; he is pretty amazing.
Just going through a marriage and a divorce - which I essentially did by 21 - will give you an insane amount of perspective on life.
"Working with food was fraught with anxiety when I was a girl. Like all farmers, we were at the mercy of the weather, and we lived in fear of crop failure."
"Communication is a skill that you can learn. It's like riding a bicycle or typing. If you're willing to work at it, you can rapidly improve the quality of evry part of your life."
"The music industry is something that I'm still trying to understand. With acting, I've been doing it for so long that I understand every aspect of it for the most part - there are obviously still more aspects that I need to learn - but I have a grasp on it. With music, I'm still learning. I'm still getting used to it."
"We learn wisdom from failure much more than from success. We often discover what will do, by finding out what will not do; and probably he who never made a mistake never made a discovery."
"That's the key to success, isn't it? It has to be fun."
"The position is: the Gaelic language is no longer the native language; it is dead, yet food is being brought to the graveyard."
"I'm not going to get somewhere and say, 'OK, I'm done.' Success is never final; I'll just keep on going. The same way as failure never being fatal. Just keep going. I'm going to the stars and then past them."
"It's only through listening that you learn, and I never want to stop learning."
"There's a time in your life where you're not quite sure where you are. You think everything's perfect, but it's not perfect... Then one day you wake up and you can't quite picture yourself in the situation you're in. But the secret is, if you can picture yourself doing anything in life, you can do it."
"If there is such a thing as a good marriage, it is because it resembles friendship rather than love."
"I slept and dreamt that life was joy. I awoke and saw that life was service. I acted and behold, service was joy."
The deep joy we take in the company of people with whom we have just recently fallen in love is undisguisable.

Success is the maximum utilization of the ability that you have.
I have worked very hard to shed away my chocolate boy image in order to get a tough look for this action entertainer. I am confident of my success and would love to dedicate the same to Director Balachandar sir.

I do not regard a broker as a member of the human race.
People with a sense of humor tend to be less egocentric and more realistic in their view of the world and more humble in moments of success and less defeated in times of travail.

"To some it may be a thrill to be known, to me it's a thrill to start a friendship even up."
"The woman is a gentle, loving bond who encourages, consoles, builds, reconciles, and makes all things new and vibrant. The woman is strength in time of suffering, courageous in failure, intuitive in time of danger. A woman is ingenuous when all fails, resourceful in times of want, and a true helpmate for man."
"It is wisdom in prosperity, when all is as thou wouldn't have it, to fear and suspect the worst."
Art school had taught me it was far better to be a flamboyant failure than any kind of benign success.
Love is our true destiny. We do not find the meaning of life by ourselves alone - we find it with another.
A man who has never made a woman angry is a failure in life.
Begin to be now what you will be hereafter.
"What can a pencil do for all of us? Amazing things. It can write transcendent poetry, uplifting music, or life-changing equations; it can sketch the future, give life to untold beauty, and communicate the full-force of our love and aspirations."
Eating good food is my favourite thing in the whole world. Nothing is more blissful.
"I went to work in accounting at Arthur Andersen. At one point, it was the creme de la creme. I wanted to work there because it looked like the hardest thing I could find, and I loved being on a steep learning curve. I progressed quickly, and two years out of college, I was managing a small team of people."
"What the mass media offers is not popular art, but entertainment which is intended to be consumed like food, forgotten, and replaced by a new dish."
"Please all, and you will please none."
"In many ways, it was much, much harder to get the first book contract. The hardest thing probably overall has been learning not to trust people, publicists and so forth, implicitly."
A part of kindness consists in loving people more than they deserve.

"While I thought that I was learning how to live, I have been learning how to die."
I have yet to hear a man ask for advice on how to combine marriage and a career.
"In actuality, California could be a wonderful place to live. In fact, if you're highly educated and ambitious, you can do quite well here while enjoying the sun and the fun. The only problem: California will then blame you for your success and recommend that all your cash be removed from you."
Love is being stupid together.
"If you are a lawyer, and you want to take on easier cases, you can prosecute traffic violations or something. You'd have a very high rate of success, and you probably could sleep more easily at night. But that's not what drives me."
Success is only meaningful and enjoyable if it feels like your own.
"As a parent and a citizen, I'll take a Bill Gates (or Warren Buffett) over Steve Jobs every time. If we must have billionaires, better they should ignore Jobs's example and instead embrace the morality and wisdom of the great industrialist-philanthropist Andrew Carnegie."
"I've never been a jealous person, and I've never felt built up by someone else's failure - that's a cheap thrill."
"Athol Fugard became famous as a playwright, so although 'Tsotsi' the book was written in the '60s, it was only published in the '80s. It was then optioned pretty much every year by producers. I think the problem was that holding onto its period setting made it very hard to get finance."
"The cure for all the ills and wrongs, the cares, the sorrows, and the crimes of humanity, all lie in the one word 'love'. It is the divine vitality that everywhere produces and restores life."

"Learning from wolves to interact with pet dogs makes about as much sense as, 'I want to improve my parenting - let's see how the chimps do it!'"
I don't find it a struggle to maintain a healthy diet now as my palate has changed. I don't crave rich food.
"There is an amazing power getting to know your inner self and learning how to use it and not fight with the world. If you know what makes you happy, your personality, interests and capabilities, just use them, and everything else flows beautifully."
"In God's world, for those who are in earnest, there is no failure. No work truly done, no word earnestly spoken, no sacrifice freely made, was ever made in vain."
"One of the things, one of the things that really got to me was the thing in Houston where you had the government, the mayor actually, trying to get the sermons of ministers. When the government tries to invade the church to enforce its own opinion on marriage, that's when it's time to resist."
"Believe me, I understand the need for easy and speedy. After a 12-hour day of shooting 'Chopped,' say, I'm talking stir-fry, spaghetti, heck, peanut-butter sandwiches. But that's not about the joy of food. That's survival."
"If you are not too long, I will wait here for you all my life."
"I still think it's essential for a parent to cook with their children. Weighing out the ingredients and learning where the food comes from is educational, but it also helps to place meal times at the heart of family life. We never had dinner in front of the TV."
I don't believe you have to be better than everybody else. I believe you have to be better than you ever thought you could be.

"All you need in this life is ignorance and confidence, and then success is sure."
A person who doubts himself is like a man who would enlist in the ranks of his enemies and bear arms against himself. He makes his failure certain by himself being the first person to be convinced of it.

Success is the only motivational factor that a boy with character needs.
"When I was an actor, I worked with lots of men who had a bit of success early on, who were very good looking, who suddenly made a bit of money and who felt no embarrassment - and nor should they have done - about having a good time."
To do a common thing uncommonly well brings success.
"I believe in trusting men, not only once but twice - in giving a failure another chance."
"I don't care how handsome or fabulous or funny the groom is, or how sweet and accommodating the bride, or vice versa. Marriage is hard."
"In fact, corporate and union moneys go overwhelmingly to incumbents, so limiting that money, as Congress did in the campaign finance law, may be the single most self-denying thing that Congress has ever done."
"We waste time looking for the perfect lover, instead of creating the perfect love."
Love is rarer than genius itself. And friendship is rarer than love.
Love is flower like; Friendship is like a sheltering tree.
"By seeing London, I have seen as much of life as the world can show."
"Jobs for every American is doomed to failure because of modern automation and production. We ought to recognize it and create an income-maintenance system so every single American has the dignity and the wherewithal for shelter, basic food, and medical care.

"I keep my friends as misers do their treasure, because, of all the things granted us by wisdom, none is greater or better than friendship."

My love for ice cream emerged at an early age - and has never left!
"Reading is an exercise for learning how to write and vice versa. I have read myself into being a Christian, but I have also written myself into being a Christian."

Obstacles are those frightful things you see when you take your eyes off your goal.
"Be strong, believe in freedom and in God, love yourself, understand your sexuality, have a sense of humor, masturbate, don't judge people by their religion, color or sexual habits, love life and your family."
"Women's strength, women's industry, women's wisdom are humankind's greatest untapped resource. The challenge then for U.N. Women is to show our diverse constituencies how this resource can be effectively tapped in ways that benefit us all."
"In school, we learn that mistakes translate into bad grades. This unfortunate lesson gets burned into our brains, and we go through life shunning challenges that might end in failure."
"I didn't like England. I couldn't take the look of the place or the style of friendship. I need more intimacy from people than is considered okay there, and I felt that my personality and my enthusiasms weren't understood. I had to put a big lid on myself."
Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith.
"By the time I was a young man, I lived with two deep struggles: I longed to become a cricketer, and I performed miserably in school. Cricket and tennis were all that I lived for. In India, this was a formula for failure."

I don't believe people are looking for the meaning of life as much as they are looking for the experience of being alive.
"Ultimately, all human activities have as their goal the realization of happiness. Why, then, have we ended up producing the opposite result? Could the underlying cause be our failure to correctly understand the true nature of happiness?"
"If a man walks in the woods for love of them half of each day, he is in danger of being regarded as a loafer. But if he spends his days as a speculator, shearing off those woods and making the earth bald before her time, he is deemed an industrious and enterprising citizen."
Fortunately analysis is not the only way to resolve inner conflicts. Life itself still remains a very effective therapist.

"Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none."
"True wisdom comes to each of us when we realize how little we understand about life, ourselves, and the world around us."
"When I started learning the cello, I fell in love with the instrument because it seemed like a voice - my voice."
"Nobody gets to live life backward. Look ahead, that is where your future lies."
I think people are free to marry any way they want to. But churches are free to set standards for marriage.
"When preaching is done right, it can change lives. When it's done badly, my failure goes beyond the merely human."
"When the bank asks me about my assets, I include my friendship with Regis Philbin."
"Someday, after mastering the winds, the waves, the tides and gravity, we shall harness for God the energies of love, and then, for a second time in the history of the world, man will have discovered fire."
"We learn wisdom from failure much more than from success. We often discover what will do, by finding out what will not do; and probably he who never made a mistake never made a discovery."
"I am an enthusiast, but not a crank in the sense that I have some pet theories as to the proper construction of a flying machine. I wish to avail myself of all that is already known and then, if possible, add my mite to help on the future worker who will attain final success."
Success is what you do with your ability. It's how you use your talent.

Perseverance is not a long race; it is many short races one after the other.
Sometimes the heart sees what is invisible to the eye.
"During the Arab Spring, I learned all sorts of things from Twitter. I wouldn't necessarily trust that information, but it gave me ideas about questions to ask. You can really learn things from the wisdom of crowds."
"I know I'm likeable, but living with me is different. Yes, I can be charming. That desire to please people and learning what to do to charm their socks off is something many of us do. But you get into a relationship, and the party's over at some point. They see the real you."
I look at where I'm at today and realize that most of my success is owed to the mentors that was in my life.
A man should always consider how much he has more than he wants.
I love my wife and I know she loves me. We're best friends. We're just lucky to have found each other. It takes a lot of work but I just feel very blessed that I found the right person. It's a very fortunate situation and not everyone has that.
"If God did not intend for us to eat animals, then why did he make them out of meat?"
"I'm killing two birds at once, so to speak. Animal-based food kills people. This way, by going vegan... we get healthy and save animals. I'm being selfish, too, because if I can get my employees healthier, we cut down on sick days and gain more productivity."
"Heaven knows that I have done all that a mortal could do, to save the people, and the failure was not my fault, but the fault of others."

"In Rome, I particularly love the history, churches, sculptures and architecture and the fact that you can walk along a tiny cobbled street and turn the corner to find the Trevi Fountain. London is evocative of other eras and full of history."
"Each step of the way I'm learning. When I leave an interview, I learn whether I feel, 'Oh, that was nice,' or that made me feel like a little piece of me was taken. It's a line that is always on the edge of being crossed, and once you cross it, what's next?"
I do think of Bombay as my hometown. Those are the streets I walked when I was learning to walk. And it's the place that my imagination has returned to more than anywhere else.

"I'm a humanist. I always believed, even with Cirque du Soliel, that this is my way to contribute to a better world. I believe I'm very privileged, but many people face the reality when they wake up in the morning of not having food or a glass of water. Life's been good to me, and I believe you have to feed the circle of life."
"When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor."
The smells of slow cooking spread around the house and impart a unique warmth matched only by the flavour of the food.
"The U.S. has a law on the books called the debt limit, but the name is misleading. The debt limit started in 1917 for the purpose of facilitating more national debt, not reducing it. It still serves that purpose. It's unconnected to spending, hurts our credit rating and has been an abject failure at limiting debt."
We need leaders who will stand unapologetically in defense of marriage.
"Be happy with being you. Love your flaws. Own your quirks. And know that you are just as perfect as anyone else, exactly as you are."

"It's easy to get negative because you get beat down. You go through a few disappointments and it's easy to stay in that negative frame of mind. Choosing to be positive and having a grateful attitude is a whole cliche, but your attitude is going to determine how you're going to live your life."

Honesty is the fastest way to prevent a mistake from turning into a failure.

"So I've seen life as one long learning process. And if I see - you know, if I fly on somebody else's airline and find the experience is not a pleasant one, which it wasn't in - 21 years ago, then I'd think, well, you know, maybe I can create the kind of airline that I'd like to fly on."

One part of wisdom is knowing what you don't need anymore and letting it go.

Friendship is almost always the union of a part of one mind with the part of another; people are friends in spots.
"The wisdom of crowds works when the crowd is choosing the price of an ox, when there's a single numeric average. But if it's a design or something that matters, the decision is made by committee, and that's crap. You want people and groups who are able to think thoughts before they share."
"The more you praise and celebrate your life, the more there is in life to celebrate."

"I think when you're talking about marriage equality and race, people very quickly start to get into their political corners: their ideology comes to the forefront, and they get into this platform argument that they're used to making, which really doesn't have anything to do with the day-to-day basics of what is being talked about."
"If you really want to make a friend, go to someone's house and eat with him... the people who give you their food give you their heart."

But the fact that same-sex marriage is still an issue is insane. Thinking love knows a sex is ridiculous.
"The characteristic human trait is not awareness but conformity, and the characteristic result is religious warfare. Other animals fight for territory or food; but, uniquely in the animal kingdom, human beings fight for their 'beliefs.'"
"I think, with Hank Paulson, the concept of a bailout was anathema to him from day one. He was a Republican; he's a free marketeer. He believes in capitalism, and part of capitalism is believing in failure. And so the idea of bailing out an institution, I think, went against every part of him."

"Every company needs to have a skunkworks, to try things that have a high probability of failing. You try to minimize failure, but at the same time, if you're not willing to try things that are inherently risky, you're not going to make progress."

"I get unhappy doing things that I'm not passionate about. Because I feel like I'm squandering this incredible gift I've been given to finance films. As soon as my name alone was enough to make this happen, I vowed to myself that I was going to work with directors who were changing cinema, doing something important, you know?"
I think I've failed every test I've ever taken. If there was a failure I would have been it.
"You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something - your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life."

Success is simply a matter of luck. Ask any failure.

"Every one in the world ought to do the things for which he is specially adapted. It is the part of wisdom to recognize what each one of us is best fitted for, and it is the part of education to perfect and utilize such predispositions. Because education can direct and aid nature but can never transform her."

"The optimist underestimates how difficult it is to achieve real change, believing that anything is possible and it's possible now. Only by confronting head-on the reality that all progress is going to be obstructed by vested interests and corrupted by human venality can we create realistic programmes that actually have a chance of success."

"I'm not going to school just for the academics - I wanted to share ideas, to be around people who are passionate about learning."
